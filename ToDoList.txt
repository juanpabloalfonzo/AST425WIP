To do:

Take Generated kinematic profile plots and find difference across variables across all 3 PCA's per plot. Overplot this for every galaxy type/bins
and oberseve any trends that emerge
-Make function that saves PCA result arrays so we can find differences in variables 
-This will look like a giant matrix in which every element will be a plot of a specific variable difference across galaxy types/bins
-Each array element will have 3 points per profile plot it pulls from (one point per PCA vector)
-Diagonals will be empty/null plots as trivially any variable minus itself will always be 0


Need to make:
Look for PCA vectors in the galaxy picture space by multiplying pixel value by PC vector component along that direction 
-Working on why Image calls from Marvin API are not working
