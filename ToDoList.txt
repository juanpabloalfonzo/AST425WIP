To do:

Pending Approval:
Mix Marvin Pixel Data with Schema table Data and plug into PCA (Generalize existing function to take in multiple galaxies at once and combine maps)
-Failing with larger plateifu list, works in function.py but not in sampleselection.py
-Add boostraping to this family of functions 

Need to make:
Look for PCA vectors in the galaxy picture space by multiplying pixel value by PC vector component along that direction
