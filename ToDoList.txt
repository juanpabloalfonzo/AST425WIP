To do:

Need to Modify:
Download Marvin Maps (run twice and it magically works(ie its trying to read faster than it can write the file) )

Boostrap across spaxels not galaxies (works, but need to make sure all the eigenvalues are of the same sign, 
use np.diff to find largest difference make the signs agree) (dot product way seems to work, ensure its correct before working it into the bootstrap functions)


Need to make:
Mix Marvin Pixel Data with Schema table Data and plug into PCA (Generalize existing function to take in multiple galacies at once)

Look for PCA vectors in the galaxy picture space by multiplying pixel value by PC vector component along that direction
