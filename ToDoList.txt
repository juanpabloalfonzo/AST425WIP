Bootstrapping and Jackknife PCA methods to get error bars (done, double check magnitude of errors)

Put more galaxies together and feed it into PCA (Have to find way around since maps all have different dimensions, list maybe? since they can expand to data size)

Mix Marvin Pixel Data with Schema table Data and plug into PCA

Look for PCA vectors in the galaxy picture space by multiplying pixel value by PC vector component along that direction
